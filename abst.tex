 Covid 19 is creating havoc in the world. The transmission of the disease was viewed as spread through person-to-person that make it easily diffuse. The infection spreading starts from the infectee droplets during sneezing or coughing. In order to reduce the spread of coronavirus, any contacts between people and potential carriers of the virus have to be limited. In current circumstances, social distancing and constant disinfection of public places become a necessity. Though, nowadays it is essential to sanitize hands, touching the same bottle surface already used by someone may increase the risk of contamination. So we have designed a smart touchless hand sanitizer-dispensing system using Iot. It also has feature such as auto refilling to reduce human labour and also possess alarm to remind person to sanitize hand before entering the premises and also keeps count of persons to monitor the no of  persons present in the premises.
